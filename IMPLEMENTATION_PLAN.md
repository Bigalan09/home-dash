# Implementation Plan: Timer and Recipe Features

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for adding Timer and Recipe features to the Home Dashboard.

## Phase 1: Setup and Preparation

### Task 1: Environment Setup
- [ ] Create new HTML files: `timer.html` and `recipes.html`
- [ ] Update navigation in `index.html` to link to new pages
- [ ] Ensure consistent styling with existing dashboard theme
- [ ] Set up development environment for testing

### Task 2: Timer Page Structure
- [ ] Create basic HTML structure for timer page
- [ ] Implement CSS for full-screen progress visualization
- [ ] Add preset duration buttons (5, 10, 20, 30 minutes)
- [ ] Add control buttons (Start/Pause, Restart, Dismiss)

### Task 3: Recipe Page Structure
- [ ] Create basic HTML structure for recipe page
- [ ] Implement CSS for card-based layout
- [ ] Add navigation controls (swipe, back button)
- [ ] Add share button functionality

## Phase 2: Core Functionality Implementation

### Task 4: Timer Logic
- [ ] Implement timer state management (setup, running, paused, completed)
- [ ] Create JavaScript functions for timer controls
- [ ] Add visual progress bar that fills from bottom to top
- [ ] Implement localStorage persistence for active timer

### Task 5: Recipe API Integration
- [ ] Research and select appropriate free recipe API
- [ ] Implement API integration with fetch requests
- [ ] Create recipe data parsing and display functions
- [ ] Add error handling for API failures

### Task 6: User Interface Enhancements
- [ ] Add smooth animations for timer progress
- [ ] Implement swipe navigation for recipes
- [ ] Add visual feedback for button interactions
- [ ] Ensure responsive design for 720x1280 display

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

### Task 7: Timer Completion Handling
- [ ] Implement visual notification for completed timers
- [ ] Add dismiss functionality to return to dashboard
- [ ] Ensure clean state transition on dismissal
- [ ] Test timer persistence across page refreshes

### Task 8: Recipe Sharing
- [ ] Implement email sharing functionality
- [ ] Add URL copying fallback for email sharing
- [ ] Test sharing across different email clients
- [ ] Add visual feedback for successful sharing

### Task 9: Polish and Refinement
- [ ] Fine-tune visual design and animations
- [ ] Optimize performance for Raspberry Pi hardware
- [ ] Test all functionality on target device
- [ ] Ensure consistent styling with existing pages

## Phase 4: Testing and Deployment

### Task 10: Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Test timer functionality with various durations
- [ ] Verify recipe API integration and display
- [ ] Test swipe navigation and sharing features
- [ ] Validate localStorage persistence

## Resources Needed
- Access to free recipe API (Spoonacular, Edamam, or similar)
- Development environment with Bun.js
- Raspberry Pi Touch Display 2 for testing
- Email account for testing sharing functionality
